# bardBot
Bardbot is a python program, that uses the bardapi to connect to discord as a bot.  Command !bard <ask whatever you want> and it will poll bard and give a response via discord.  You will need to use the key of a cookie from your google account.  

Get your bard api key from instructions here https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API

Works great using python directly.  Still having an issue with images getting passed, when ran in docker.
